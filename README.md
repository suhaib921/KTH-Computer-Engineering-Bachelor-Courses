## [IK1203 - Networks and Communication]()

The course is an introduction to networking, protocols and communication.

We study how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. We use the Internet as or working example of such a network. The course aims to give insights into both the theory and practice of the area.

The focus of the course is on the use of protocols and algorithms, particularly their application and integration within the TCP/IP stack, which forms the Internet's foundation.

### Course Content and Learning Outcomes

- **Flow and Error Management**: Techniques for flow control such as stop-and-wait and sliding window, alongside mechanisms for error detection, correction, and retransmission (Automatic Repeat reQuest - ARQ).
- **Network Layering Concepts**: An examination of the OSI and TCP/IP models, understanding their layered architectures.
- **Local Area Networks (LAN)**: Study of LAN topologies, access methods, and protocols including token ring and Ethernet, as well as wireless networks, bridged and VLAN networks, with an emphasis on spanning tree computation.
- **Switching Techniques**: Differentiating between packet and circuit switching in the context of Wide Area Networks (WAN) and public network infrastructures, including their principles, characteristics, and protocols.
- **The Internet and Internetworking**: Principles of Internet design, connection-oriented vs. connectionless protocols, IP routing, and the Internet Protocol suite.
- **Transport Layer Protocols**: In-depth look at TCP and UDP, understanding their roles in the transport layer.
- **Communication Models**: Exploration of client-server and peer-to-peer communication paradigms.
- **Network Applications**: Overview of various network applications such as DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, and Telnet, among others.
- **Network Programming**: Introduction to programming within the network context.



## [ME1003 - Industrial Management, Basic Course]()
This course offers a foundational understanding of industrial management, essential for engineers to engage in technology-driven business, manage projects, develop operations, and lead teams within contemporary companies. 

### Course topics include:
-   Describing various technology-based business models and the dynamics of value creation, proposition, and capture in industrial activities.
-   Outlining how industrial operations are directed and organized.
-   Applying and interpreting economic calculations for decision-making in various business contexts.
-   Understanding the basic concepts and principles of accounting and finance, including how an industrial company's operations can be funded.
-   Compiling and analyzing financial reports for an industrial company.
-   Describing the business operations and strategic positioning of an existing industrial company using concepts from industrial economics, and performing a basic economic analysis of the company's activities, financial health, and financing methods.

## [DH2642 - Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web]()
This course explores the foundational principles of Model-View-Controller (MVC) for crafting interactive software. These principles are adaptable across a range of platforms including desktop, mobile, and web applications. The curriculum is tailored to web development, with a focus on JavaScript, DOM APIs, HTML, CSS, etc. The front-end interfaces developed utilize data provided by remote back-ends through web APIs.

### Course topics include:
-   JavaScript for interaction programming, callbacks, synchronous and asynchronous code, functional programming.
-   Web development interfaces (API): REST, JSON, AJAX, Fetch, Promises.
-   Local data: cookies, local storage.
-   User interfaces, appearance: HTML, CSS, DOM API, other tree based frameworks for user interfaces (e g Android).
-   User interfaces, interaction: events, event levels, event propagation, event management.
-   User interfaces, architectures: Model-View-Controller.
-   User interfaces, frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.

## [IV1351 - Data Storage Paradigms]()
This course serves as an introduction to the realm of data storage and databases, covering:

-   Basics of databases, data storage, and information management.
-   The relational database model.
-   XML usage.
-   Conceptual modeling and logical database design.
-   Query language utilization.
-   Integration of query languages into applications.

### Project Description, the Soundgood Music School
The purpose is to facilitate information handling and business transactions for the Soundgood music school company, by developing a database which handles all the school's data and also an application that can handle some of the transactions.

Building a database without structure will most likely end up failing or being extremely bad. In this project the author will structurally build a database for the Soundgood music school. The author solved the task by building a conceptual model, logical model and then translating it to SQL code to create the database itself. The database can perform various of different tasks such as managing the schoolÂ´s instruments, lessons, students, and instructors. A command line interface will be developed to manage some aspects of the database. The author will be discussing and motivating each step of designing the database and how each step of the project was solved.
